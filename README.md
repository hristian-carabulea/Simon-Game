### - You must remember all the flashed squares in the sequence they were flashed.
### - Then you have to click on the specific squares in the sequence they were flashed.
### - The game ends when the player does not press on all the squares in the correct sequence.
### - I added mobile functionality as well - see "How-to-start-Simon-on-mobile-phone.jpg"
